# Description
**Date**:: 2023-10-08
**Recipe**:: [[Honey Mead - FaP Brewing]]

# Observations
- Poured some out to test
- Smelled sour, yeasty
- Taste test was definitely very strong
- Princess figured out we took our final gravity reading *after* backsweetening, throwing off the number, which would explain why itâ€™s strong but with a low ABV
- Hydrometer readings:
	- BRIX: 10
	- SG wort: 1.040
